title: "DataMop: A Python Package for Streamlined EDA"
date: 2025-03-27
summary: "A Python package designed to simplify and standardize exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflows for data scientists and analysts."
---

**DataMop** is a data cleaning and wrangling python package designed to streamline the preprocessing of datasets. Whether you meet missing values, inconsistent categorical columns or need scaling for numeric columns when dealing with data. datamop provides a simple and consistent solution to automate and simplify these repetitive tasks. It aims to streamline the **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** process by providing a clean, consistent, and efficient API to automate common data cleaning and profiling tasks.

As part of a four-member team, I contributed to:
- Designing modular functions for tasks like missing value imputation, outlier detection, and data type profiling.
- Writing unit tests and documentation to ensure code reliability and usability.
- Publishing the package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/datamop/) and maintaining the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DataMop_package_group14).

#### âœ¨ Features
The following are core functions of this package:

- sweep_nulls(): Handles missing values such as imputation or removal, based on user preference.

- column_encoder(): Encodes categorical columns using either one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding, based on user preference.

- column_scaler(): Scales numerical columns, including Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization, based on user preference.
