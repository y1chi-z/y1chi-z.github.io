Hi! I'm **Yichi (Essie) Zhang**, a data scientist with a strong foundation in statistics, machine learning, and business analytics. I thrive on using data to solve real-world problems, communicate insights, and support decision-making across diverse industries including retail, FMCG, real estate, and e-commerce.

With a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia (expected July 2025) and an MS in Business Analytics from Boston University, I've worked on projects ranging from demand forecasting and dashboard design to customer behavior analysis and ad tracking. 

Previously, I worked at **GrowingIO**, where I helped companies like **LEGO**, **Danone**, and **Lululemon** improve forecasting accuracy, monitor product performance in real time, and optimize marketing effectiveness. I also have hands-on experience building predictive models, developing metrics, and communicating with both technical teams and business stakeholders.

Some highlights from my work:
- Reduced LEGO’s sales forecast error from 90.3% to 19.8% using Python-based modeling.
- Designed and deployed real-time dashboards for Danone product analytics.
- Delivered weekly marketing channel analysis that contributed to GMV growth for Lululemon.

I’m passionate about creating impactful, data-driven solutions and always eager to collaborate on innovative projects.
