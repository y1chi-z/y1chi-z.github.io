About this site

Hello world! 
My name is Essie Zhang, and I am currently a UBC MDS student.
I graduated from Boston University 2 years ago. This is my first time living in Canada.
I am a huge dog person. My dog name is Yelo and she is a three years old shiba inu.
I love jogging outside when the weather is nice.
